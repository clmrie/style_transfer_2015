# 🖼️ Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

Blend the content of one image with the artistic style of another using a pretrained VGG19 model.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Pillow

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place your images in the working directory:
   - `content.png`
   - `style.png`

2. Run the script:

```bash
python style_transfer.py
```

3. The output will be saved as `output.png`.

## ⚙️ Features

- Supports GPU acceleration
- Based on VGG19 from torchvision
- Easily customizable content/style layers
