Sure! Here's a clean and concise `README.md` you can use for your neural style transfer project:

---

```markdown
# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

This project performs neural style transfer using a pretrained VGG19 model. It blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `content.png`: The image to preserve the structure from.
- `style.png`: The image to transfer the artistic style from.
- `output.png`: The generated image with combined content and style.
- `style_transfer.py`: Main script for processing and optimization.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place `content.png` and `style.png` in your working directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python style_transfer.py
   ```
3. The output will be saved as `output.png`.

## 🧠 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Pillow

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow
```

## ⚙️ Features

- GPU support (if available)
- Clean architecture with content/style loss modules
- Supports remote or local image inputs

Feel free to experiment with different style/content images or layer configurations!
