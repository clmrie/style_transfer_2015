Sure! Here's a full `README.md` you can copy-paste for your project â€” it covers:

1. **What the project does**  
2. **How it works (briefly)**  
3. **How to run it**

# ðŸŽ¨ Neural Style Transfer

This project applies **neural style transfer** to generate a new image that combines the **content of one image** with the **artistic style of another**. For example, you can take a photo and repaint it in the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The algorithm uses a **pretrained VGG19** convolutional neural network from PyTorch. It extracts features from:

- The **content image** to preserve its structure
- The **style image** to capture textures and patterns

Then, it optimizes a copy of the content image to match the style features, using **content and style loss functions** based on the CNN's feature maps.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow requests
```

### 2. Place Your Images

Save your input images in the same directory:
- `content.png` â€“ the image you want to preserve
- `style.png` â€“ the image you want to mimic stylistically

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python style_transfer.py
```

The final output will be saved as:
```
output.png
```

---

Feel free to tweak the content/style layers or weights to experiment with different effects.
